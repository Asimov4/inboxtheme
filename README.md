# Inbox Theme for Gmail
Google is [shutting down Google Inbox next year](https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/inbox-signing-find-your-favorite-features-new-gmail/), asking users to switch over to Gmail. Although many Inbox features have made their way to Gmail, the visual experience is still quite different. 

This Google Chrome extension brings Gmail closer to Inbox's visual style. While Google is likely to update Gmail's design to follow their [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/) in the future, this extension serves as a stopgap solutions for us who are used to Inbox.

# How it works
[Just install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/albppgldjlaflgenhggocpigdgdmgpee/) the extension on the Chrome Web Store, then simply open Gmail. To go back to regular Gmail, just turn off the extension.

# Roadmap
## Near term
- Visually replace Star with Pin (even though they behave slightly differently)
- Make it possible to filter out non-Pinned/Starred items in the Inbox
- Update icons to match Inbox
- Tweak toolbar layout to be more visially similar to that of Inbox
- Tweak message list layout to be more visially similar to that of Inbox
- Tweak message display layout to be more visially similar to that of Inbox
- Clicking header should reload current page

## Future
- Figure out how to port Reminders to Gmail's Tasks.
- Add wizard to update settings to match Inbox (density, keyboard shortcuts, inbox, etc)
- Copy "All Mail" section to third position, rename to "Done"
- *What else?* Suggestions welcome!
