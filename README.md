# Inbox Theme for Gmail
Google is [sunsetting Google Inbox in favor of Gmail during next year](https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/inbox-signing-find-your-favorite-features-new-gmail/). While many Inbox features have made their way to Gmail, the visual experience is still quite different. This Google Chrome extension brings Gmail closer to Inbox's visual style. While Google is likely to update Gmail's design to follow their [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/) in the future, this extension serves as a stopgap solutions for us who are used to Inbox.

# How it works
This extension inserts CSS and Javascript that brings Gmail's visual appearance and behavior closer to Inbox.

An options page is in the works, but for now the extension triggers automatically.

# Roadmap
## Near term
- Visually replace Star with Pin (even though they behave slightly differently)
- Make it possible to filter out non-Pinned/Starred items in the Inbox
- Update icons to match Inbox
- Tweak toolbar layout to be more visially similar to that of Inbox
- Tweak message list layout to be more visially similar to that of Inbox
- Tweak message display layout to be more visially similar to that of Inbox

## Future
- Add wizard to update settings to match Inbox (density, keyboard shortcuts, inbox, etc)
- Copy "All Mail" section to third position, rename to "Done"
- *What else?* Suggestions welcome!
