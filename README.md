#Roadmap
##Near term
- Visually replace Star with Pin (even though they behave slightly differently)
- Make it possible to filter out non-Pinned/Starred items in the Inbox
- Update icons to match Inbox
- Tweak toolbar layout to be more visially similar to that of Inbox
- Tweak message list layout to be more visially similar to that of Inbox
- Tweak message display layout to be more visially similar to that of Inbox

##Future
- Add wizard to update settings to match Inbox (density, keyboard shortcuts, inbox, etc)
- Copy "All Mail" section to third position, rename to "Done"
- *What else?* Suggestions welcome!
